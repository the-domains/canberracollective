# About.

An amalgamation of automotive photography and artificial intelligence, the Canberra Collective website resides on an AI platform that designs itself. I'm going to call her Alice for no particular reason other than it seems rather fitting. We feed Alice content and she decides the rest - Simple, right?

The site will continue to grow and evolve with each piece of new content published. If you have a unique vehicle that would make a good addition to our site, please feel free to reach out and we'll let you know if Alice is interested.
